which placed a valuation on it of just over $16bn (£12bn).","The sale came even as Spotify was making a confidential filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to take itself public through the unusual mechanism of a direct listing.","This route to the stock market would not involve issuing any new shares to raise additional capital, but simply list its existing shares.","Sources close to DE Shaw\u0027s share sale said the fund manager had sold out at roughly double the $8bn valuation at which it had initially invested nearly three years ago.","Secondary share trades such as this are not unusual, with buoyant demand for Spotify stock pushing its valuation to ever-higher levels over recent months.","Last summer, Sky News revealed that various Goldman Sachs entities had sold more than $75m of Spotify shares even as the Wall Street bank was cementing its role as an adviser on the music company\u0027s public listing.","The Goldman shares sales were made at a price of $3,100 each, more than 20% below that paid to DE Shaw just four months later.","The buyers of DE Shaw\u0027s stake were vehicles affiliated to hedge funds Tiger Global Management and Blue Ridge, the latter of which has since drawn up plans to close its doors.","Other Spotify shareholders to have reduced their exposure to the company in recent months were Fidelity, the giant American asset manager.","Under Spotify\u0027s articles of association, shares must be offered to existing investors before being sold to a third party.","The music-streaming company, which has struck licensing deals with record labels including Universal Music Group in recent months, has also announced a share swap with Tencent Music Entertainment, a Chinese peer.","Spotify\u0027s attempt to go public via a direct listing rather than a conventional initial public offering would save substantial sums on underwriting fees but more significantly reduce the amount of money owed to investors in interest as part of a convertible debt instrument issued in 2016.","The company has amassed 70m paying subscribers since its launch, and financiers believe it is likely to seek a price tag of about $20bn when its shares begin trading publicly.","Its alliances with the major music publishers has brought big-name artists such as Adele, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift - who had previously objected to Spotify\u0027s business model - into the streaming service\u0027s long-term catalogue.","The Swedish-based music service has surprised some music industry analysts with its rapid subscriber growth over the last year, although it lost nearly €175m in 2015.","Its paying customers hand over a fixed fee each month in exchange ‎for unlimited access to tens of millions of songs.","The explosive growth of such services, with rivals including Apple Music and Deezer, saw more than 68bn songs streamed last year, according to the BPI trade body.","Spotify and DE Shaw both declined to comment."],"newsType":"normal"},"url":"http:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/us-fund-giant-de-shaw-sells-spotify-shares-before-20bn-listing-11201122","mainPhoto":{"url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/17\/08\/{width}x{height}\/b86bebf5e71c8e54eef4dd3b21f5ec85112c44839fd775473558ad8ea8357b2a_4074263.jpg?20170815121806","source":"Reuters"},"photo":{"url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/17\/08\/{width}x{height}\/b86bebf5e71c8e54eef4dd3b21f5ec85112c44839fd775473558ad8ea8357b2a_4074263.jpg?20170815121806","source":"Reuters"}},{"id":"11200261","type":"story","headline":"Two injured after fire on roof of New York Trump Tower","primary":{"id":"11200261","type":"article","firstCreated":1515416700,"lastRevised":1515428340,"headline":"Two injured after fire on roof of New York Trump Tower","photo":{"url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/18\/01\/{width}x{height}\/skynews-trump-tower-fire-new-york_4200910.jpg?20180108132613","source":"Reuters"},"summary":"Two people have been injured after a fire broke out in the Trump Tower building in New York.","body":["About 84 firefighters were at the scene to battle the blaze, and video footage captured smoke billowing from the top of the luxury block.","Initial reports suggested one person was seriously injured, but the New York Fire Department later confirmed on Twitter that a civilian and a firefighter sustained minor injuries.","\u0022Our units got up there quickly, we got water on the fire,\u0022 Manhattan borough commander, assistant chief Roger Sakowich said, adding that in current cold temperatures the blaze created more smoke and steam than flame.","Footage from the scene showed a street packed with fire engines and it was reported that 26 units attended the scene.","The 58-storey Trump Tower, which houses apartments and office space, had been Donald Trump\u0027s primary residence before he became President of the United States last year.","Eric Trump, Donald Trump\u0027s son and the executive vice president of the Trump organisation, tweeted that the blaze had been caused by a small electrical fire in the cooling tower of the building\u0027s roof.","\u0022The New York Fire Department was here within minutes and did an incredible job,\u0022 he said.","The Fire Department also tweeted that a fire in a heating, ventilation and air conditioning unit (HVAC) on the roof of Trump Tower was \u0022under control\u0022.","Built in the 1980s, the Trump Tower sits at the heart of Manhattan and contains multi-million dollar apartments, owned and occupied by the super-wealthy, as well as commercial businesses."],"newsType":"normal"},"url":"http:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/fire-breaks-out-on-top-floor-of-trump-tower-11200261","video":{"id":4200891,"type":"video","firstCreated":1515416497,"lastRevised":1515435104,"headline":"Smoke billows from Trump Tower","photo":{"url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/18\/01\/{width}x{height}\/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjA4MTsiGN_4200892.jpg?20180108131604","source":"Ooyala -

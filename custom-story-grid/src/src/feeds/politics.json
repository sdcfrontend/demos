departments and a shift around of jobs at Justice, Work & Pensions, Northern Ireland, Education and the Cabinet Office.","The first problem with the reshuffle was it was over-hyped, presumably by some people who thought they were being helpful to Theresa May.","This was not helped by the Conservatives\u0027 official Twitter account wrongly heralding Chris Grayling as Sir Patrick McLoughlin\u0027s replacement as party chairman.","The second problem was that it did not assert the Prime Minister\u0027s post-Brexit negotiation authority.","In allowing Jeremy Hunt, Greg Clark, Justine Greening and Damian Hinds to hang around Downing Street for hours in total - with at least two of them pushing back against the PM\u0027s decision-making - it made for a rather public display of a lack of authority.","But above all, the principal consequence - along with the decision of Mrs May\u0027s allies to brief against Ms Greening and Mr Clark - is the PM now has a \u0022Putney problem\u0022.","Ms Greening, the Putney MP and now former education secretary, is not going quietly and her friends are furious with her treatment.","One told me: \u0022She should have absolutely

The upcoming local elections across Greater London will be extremely difficult for the Conservatives.","All this occurs before more parliamentary fireworks on the EU Withdrawal Bill, in the Commons and the Lords, and as the tougher part of Brexit negotiations hit home.","Mrs May needs the shuffle of more junior ministerial ranks to go more smoothly than this."],"newsType":"analysis"},"url":"http:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/cabinet-reshuffle-analysis-greening-departure-gives-pm-a-putney-problem-11200812","journalist":{"displayName":"Faisal Islam","blog":null,"twitter":"@faisalislam","jobRole":"Political Editor","image":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/16\/07\/{width}x{height}\/FAISALISLAM_3710794.jpg?20160706201659","firstName":"Faisal","lastName":"Islam"},"mainPhoto":{"url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/18\/01\/{width}x{height}\/skynews-greening-reshuffle_4201260.jpg?20180109032034","source":"Getty"},"photo":{"url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/18\/01\/{width}x{height}\/skynews-greening-reshuffle_4201260.jpg?20180109032034","source":"Getty"}},{"id":"11201341","type":"story","headline":"Winners and losers: What Theresa May\u0027s new Cabinet looks like","primary":{"id":"11201341","type":"article","firstCreated":1515507600,"lastRevised":1515510720,"headline":"Winners and losers: What Theresa May\u0027s new Cabinet looks like","photo":{"url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/18\/01\/{width}x{height}\/skynews-theresa-may-cabinet-meeting_4201484.jpg?20180109110658","source":"Reuters"},"byline":"Aubrey Allegretti, Political Reporter","summary":"Theresa May has conducted a New Year\u0027s reshuffle to diversify and push new talent into the Cabinet.","body":["It means some new faces enter her top team, with three different Secretaries of State and a host of other job swaps.","Press the flipcards below to find out which jobs have changed hands."],"newsType":"normal"},"url":"http:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/winners-and-losers-what-theresa-mays-new-cabinet-looks-like-11201341","mainPhoto":{"url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/18\/01\/{width}x{height}\/skynews-theresa-may-cabinet-meeting_4201484.jpg?20180109110658","source":"Reuters"},"photo":{"url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/18\/01\/{width}x{height}\/skynews-theresa-may-cabinet-meeting_4201484.jpg?20180109110658","source":"Reuters"}},{"id":"11200870","type":"story","headline":"Toby Young stands down from universities regulator","primary":{"id":"11200870","type":"article","firstCreated":1515480000,"lastRevised":1515489000,"headline":"Toby Young stands down from universities regulator","photo":{"url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/18\/01\/{width}x{height}\/skynews-toby-young-office-for-students_4197406.jpg?20180103094603","source":"PA"},"byline":"Ceren Senkul, News Reporter","summary":"Toby Young has resigned from the universities regulator following a backlash over crude and sexist tweets he sent before his appointment.","body":["Mr Young became a board member on the new Office for Students (OfS) watchdog on 1 January but had faced calls to quit after a series of controversial comments on social media surfaced.","Writing in The Spectator, the free schools pioneer said he \u0022unreservedly\u0022 apologises for things he said when he was a \u0022journalistic provocateur\u0022.","\u0022The caricature drawn of me in the last seven days, particularly on social media, has been unrecognisable to anyone who knows me.

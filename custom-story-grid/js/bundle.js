News has learnt that DE Shaw, which acquired its interest in Spotify in 2015, offloaded roughly 12,000 shares in the company last month at a price of $4,060-per-share - which placed a valuation on it of just over $16bn (£12bn).","The sale came even as Spotify was making a confidential filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to take itself public through the unusual mechanism of a direct listing.","This route to the stock market would not involve issuing any new shares to raise additional capital, but simply list its existing shares.","Sources close to DE Shaw's share sale said the fund manager had sold out at roughly double the $8bn valuation at which it had initially invested nearly three years ago.","Secondary share trades such as this are not unusual, with buoyant demand for Spotify stock pushing its valuation to ever-higher levels over recent months.","Last summer, Sky News revealed that various Goldman Sachs entities had sold more than $75m of Spotify shares even as the Wall Street bank was cementing its role as an adviser on the music company's public listing.","The Goldman shares sales were made at a price of $3,100 each, more than 20% below that paid to DE Shaw just four months later.","The buyers of DE Shaw's stake were vehicles affiliated to hedge funds Tiger Global Management and Blue Ridge, the latter of which has since drawn up plans to close its doors.","Other Spotify shareholders to have reduced their exposure to the company in recent months were Fidelity, the giant American asset manager.","Under Spotify's articles of association, shares must be offered to existing investors before being sold to a third party.","The music-streaming company, which has struck licensing deals with record labels including Universal Music Group in recent months, has also announced a share swap with Tencent Music Entertainment, a Chinese peer.","Spotify's attempt to go public via a direct listing rather than a conventional initial public offering would save substantial sums on underwriting fees but more significantly reduce the amount of money owed to investors in interest as part of a convertible debt instrument issued in 2016.","The company has amassed 70m paying subscribers since its launch, and financiers believe it is likely to seek a price tag of about $20bn when its shares begin trading publicly.","Its alliances with the major music publishers has brought big-name artists such as Adele, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift - who had previously objected to Spotify's business model - into the streaming service's long-term catalogue.","The Swedish-based music service has surprised some music industry analysts with its rapid subscriber growth over the last year, although it lost nearly €175m in 2015.","Its paying customers hand over a fixed fee each month in exchange ‎for unlimited access to tens of millions of songs.","The explosive growth of such services, with rivals including Apple Music and Deezer, saw more than 68bn songs streamed last year, according to the BPI trade body.","Spotify and DE Shaw both declined to

"Further, the severity of mobile malware is up over 400% year-over-year."',"The malicious apps that Trend Micro found only targeted Android phones.",'"Android tends to have more malware for a variety of reasons.','"For starters, there\'s the issue of platform diversification. With so many manufacturers building devices that run Android, Google cannot be as stringent with their app reviews. Google is notorious for having a more lax app review process than Apple," said Dr Covington.','"The perception is fake apps are more likely to be prevalent on Android than iOS platforms primarily due to Android\'s open community and developer platform which allows users to install applications from trusted and untrusted stores easily without little or no modification on the device," agreed Mr Mistry.','"Attackers targeting mobile users don\'t care what platform their victim prefers. Our research indicates that there are more malicious apps on Android, whereas iOS users are more likely to encounter a phishing attack," said Dr Covington.',"How to protect yourself?",'"First and foremost always use a reputable app store such as Apple\'s App Store or Google Play," said Mr Mistry.','"Secondly, before downloading an application, look at the developer and make sure that is also from a reputable source, ie do a separate search on the Internet about the developer and the application name to check the reputation of an application.','"Download a reputable malware scanning application from trusted application store and scan the device or any malicious code.','"In addition, if you think the app has stolen credentials for banking, social media and other applications, think about resetting the password for those applications using another device or desktop."'],newsType:"normal"},url:"http://news.sky.com/story/google-pulls-dozens-of-fake-security-apps-which-secretly-stole-data-11197167",mainPhoto:{url:"https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/{width}x{height}/skynews-malicious-apps-trend_4199446.jpg?20180106075856",source:"Press Release"},photo:{url:"https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/{width}x{height}/skynews-malicious-apps-trend_4199446.jpg?20180106075856",source:"Press Release"}}]}}},function(e,t){e.exports={category:{title:"ENTERTAINMENT",stories:[{id:"11200940",type:"story",headline:"BAFTA 2018: Blade Runner and Dunkirk among main nominees",primary:{id:"11200940",type:"article",firstCreated:1515485940,lastRevised:1515505860,headline:"BAFTA 2018: Blade Runner and Dunkirk among main nominees",photo:{url:"https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/{width}x{height}/skynews-blade-runner-dunkirk_4201389.jpg?20180109091605",source:"Other"},byline:"Duarte Garrido, Entertainment Reporter",summary:"Blockbusters Dunkirk and Blade Runner 2049 were the biggest surprises of the BAFTA 2018 nominations.",body:["While the Guillermo Del Toro's sci-fi romance The Shape Of Water led the nominations with 12 nods, including best film, director and actress for Sally Hawkins, that came as no surprise.","The film had already dominated nominations at the Golden Globes, but fell short of expectations at the ceremony on Sunday, losing best picture to Martin McDonagh's Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.","McDonagh's film picked up nine nominations for this year's BAFTAs, including best film, director, outstanding British film, original screenplay and best actress for Frances McDormand.","Following closely was Joe Wright's The Darkest Hour, with a nod for best film and best actor for Gary Oldman.",'"This is my third BAFTA nomination as an actor," he said.','"The recognition means so much, and especially more so not merely for the distinguished company I now find myself in with my fellow nominees, but most especially for the privilege of playing Winston Churchill - which it truly was."','<strong>:: <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/live-bafta-2018-nominations-11200897" target="_blank">As It Happened: BAFTA 2018 nominations</a></strong>',"But the real surprise were the IMAX hits of the year, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk and Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049, with eight nods each.","The two films exceeded in technical categories, and both got a best director nod for their respective filmmakers.","The highly anticipated Blade Runner sequel was snubbed by the Globes this year, but had a deeper impact on British jurors.","BAFTA's biggest snub of the year was for first-time director Greta Gerwig and her movie Lady Bird.",'<strong>:: <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/golden-globes-got-it-all-wrong-except-the-tone-11199875" target="_blank">Golden Globes got it all wrong - except the tone</a></strong>',"Not only did it fail to win a nod for best film, but also best director, leaving the category male-dominated.",'The absence of female directors nominated for the Globes on Sunday was underlined by Natalie Portman as she announced the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/hollywood-still-facing-big-questions-after-golden-globes-11199856" target="_blank">"<strong>all male nominees</strong>"</a> for best director, to gasps from the audience.','"Thank you so much for this amazing honour," Gerwig said in statement regarding her nod for best original screenplay.','"Everyone who worked on Lady Bird poured their heart and soul into it, and I am so proud of every single cast and crew member.

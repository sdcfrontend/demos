He quickly made Mr Bevan part of his cabinet, and The National Health Service Act was published in 1946.It set out a vision for a \"comprehensive health service\" for England and Wales, which would become a reality just two years later. There was separate legislation for Scotland and Northern Ireland.The NHS was born on 5 July, promising nationalised hospitals, a network of GPs, and community health services, all free at the point of use.Health secretary Aneurin Bevan launched it at Park Hospital in Manchester, today known as Trafford General Hospital.The first patient was Sylvia Diggory, 13, who had a life-threatening liver condition. She went on to become a teacher and her son, Clive Diggory, a GP. With the labour market depleted in the aftermath of the Second World War, the government looked overseas in a bid to increase the number of nurses working in the UK.A large influx came from the Caribbean - part of the Windrush generation - and the Nurses Act led to a training programme being developed at the General Nursing Council, which was completed and approved in 1952.To this day, the NHS continues to rely hugely on staff from abroad. Prescription charges were proposed, at first at a cost of just one shilling, which is about 5p in today's money.Also brought in was a flat rate of &#163;1 for ordinary dental treatment, as well as charges for glasses. Two Cambridge University scientists - Francis Crick and Jim Watson - wrote a ground-breaking article outlining the structure of DNA, which would allow for the study of diseases caused by defective genes.They rather modestly claimed that their findings were of \"considerable biological interest\". For the first time, a link is established between smoking and the development of lung cancer.Scientist Sir Richard Doll studied lung cancer patients at 20 London hospitals and found that smokers were far more likely to die from it.He gave up smoking two-thirds of the way through his research and ended up living to 92. The Guillebaud Report - set up after a request from the Treasury for an inquiry into the cost of the NHS - found that, in relative terms, spending had actually fallen in the years since it was formed.Any additional costs due to an ageing population could be covered by economic growth, the report argued. Mental health treatment was absorbed into the NHS through the Percy Commission, which had been set up by Winston Churchill's government.It concluded that the law should be changed so that people in need of mental health treatment received care with \"no more restriction of liberty\" than any other form of care, thus breaking down barriers that had existed before.It would be expanded upon further by the 1959 Mental Health Act. Polio and diphtheria vaccines became part of NHS plans, allowing everyone under the age of 15 to be protected from the diseases.Before the programme was brought in, the two diseases were responsible for around 5,000 deaths a year. For the first time, the Mental Health Act established that community care should be prioritised and that mental health patients should not be treated differently from any other people with an illness.The act was brought in off the back of the Percy Commission and repealed the Lunacy and Mental Health Treatment and Mental Deficiency Acts. The first kidney transplant in the UK took place at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 30 October, involving identical 49-year-old twins.The procedure went well, with both living for a further six years before dying of an unrelated illness.Success rates are continuing to improve, too, although demand is outstripping supply due to an ageing population. Contraceptive pills became available to married women on the NHS, contributing to the sexual freedom enjoyed in the so-called swinging sixties.The pill was made available to all women in 1967, with the number taking it rising from 50,000 to one million between 1962 and 1969. Health minister Enoch Powell announces the Hospital Plan, a 10-year programme to develop district hospitals for areas of 125,000 people.But it soon became clear that the cost and time needed to build new hospitals had been underestimated.Costs spiralled during construction and the needs of the population changed, meaning many were not totally fit for purpose by the time they were finished. Professor John Charnely carried out the first full hip replacement on the NHS at Wrightington Hospital in Wigan.Patients were asked if they minded giving the hip back when they died, allowing for further study and the development of an improved low-friction design. In response to complaints from GPs about poor working conditions, the Family Doctor's Charter was drawn up to increase pay, loosen working hours, and subsidise any premises used as a doctor's practice.GPs supported the ideas, with thousands threatening to resign if the charter was not implemented. Abortions became legal and available on the NHS thanks to the Abortion Act.They could now be carried out up to 28 weeks into the pregnancy, rather than just when the mother's life was in danger, as had been the case.The time limit was lowered to 24 weeks in 1990. Midwives at Birmingham Maternity Hospital helped deliver the landmark birth of sextuplets.The mother, Sheila Thorns, underwent a caesarean section on her 30th birthday, with 28 medical staff present.She had four girls and two boys, although one of the girls died shortly after.The other five were cared for by a specialist team, but two of them also later died.Sextuplets arrive only once every 3,000 million births. On 3 May, South African surgeon Donald Ross led a team of 18 doctors and nurses to perform the first heart transplant in the UK.The operation took place at the National Heart Hospital in Marylebone, London, and the donor was a labourer called Patrick Ryan, 26.Unfortunately the patient died just 46 days later, from an infection, leading to only six further transplants being carried out over the next decade for fear of failure. Social services secretary Sir Keith Joseph put forward a document for consultation which would have seen health services led by new regional health authorities, rather than central government.It would be 20 years until local NHS trusts became a reality. Computerised tomography (CT) scanners were introduced to hospitals, allowing doctors to produce three-dimensional images of the human body.The man behind the technology, Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield, went on to win a Nobel Prize. The Merrison Report led to the creation of the education committee at the General Medical Council, increasing the council's involvement in the training of doctors and medicine students across the country.But overall change to the NHS was minimal, despite the report providing hundreds of recommendations as to how to cope with financial challenges.The report concluded that the NHS was not a victim of \"widespread inadequacy\" and improving it would be a \"long slogging job\". Keen to address the difference in NHS spending between the South East and the rest of the UK, notably in the North, the Department of Health acted on a report that suggested using mortality rates in each area as an indicator of healthcare need.Slowly but surely, resources began to be more fairly distributed, although later reports found that inequality remained despite the NHS's core principle of providing care based on need, rather than ability to pay. Louise Brown, the world's first test-tube baby, was born on 25 July.Her parents, Lesley and John Brown, had failed to conceive because of the mother's blocked fallopian tubes.The technique to fertilise an egg outside a woman's body before replacing it in the womb was developed at Oldham General Hospital, by doctors Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards.More than one million children have now been conceived in this way. The UK's first successful bone marrow transplant took place.It was performed on a child with primary immunodeficiency at Great Ormond Street Hospital by South African doctor Professor Roland Levinsky.Professor Levinsky was later appointed as dean and director of research at the Institute for Child Health in London and would then go on to become vice-chancellor of the University of Plymouth.He died in a freak accident when overhead power cables came down during a storm in Devon in 2007. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners were introduced to hospitals across the UK, providing doctors with more information about soft tissue such as the brain, showing up things like tumours.They still work in the same way today, with patients placed inside a large cylindrical magnet, with strong radio waves then sent through the body.  The NHS revealed that childhood survival rates had improved enormously thanks to vaccination programmes, as well as better standards of living and sanitation.Pregnant women were better informed as to the dangers of smoking, drinking and poor dieting, and more births were taking place at hospitals rather than at home. An updated Mental Health Act was introduced, which included the issue of consent for treatment.Until then, people could be detained under the act and treated without their agreement.The act also introduced the Mental Health Act Commission, which was placed in charge of protecting detained patients. Benjamin Hardwick became Britain's youngest ever liver transplant patient at the age of just two.The operation took place on 23 January at Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge to treat atresia, a condition that causes bile ducts to become inflamed and damage the liver.The transplant was a success, but Benjamin died 14 months later and a memorial fund was set up in his name to support families whose children suffer from liver disease. Project 2000 was adopted to move nurse education into universities in a bid to increase the number of people taking up the profession.But it proved to be a flawed idea, as many did not have the confidence or experience to put their teachings into practice once they moved onto a ward full-time. A major public information campaign - AIDS: Don't Die Of Ignorance - was given the thumbs-up by prime minister Margaret Thatcher.In addition to leaflets, there were also powerful, chilling TV adverts featuring voiceover from actor John Hurt. They began airing in 1987.The campaign faced accusations of fear-mongering and inducing unnecessary panic, but were also credited for raising awareness and changing people's behaviours. The world's first ever liver, heart and lung transplant took place at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge.It was performed by professors Sir Roy Caine and John Wallwork, and the patient survived for a further 10 years after the procedure. Despite the NHS having been launched to provide healthcare for all, it was the conclusion of the Whitehead Report that poor people were still more likely to die earlier than those who were well-off.This was also the view of the earlier Black Report and Acheson Report.The intention was to investigate the inequality of healthcare in the UK, including gaps between social classes in the use of medical services, infant mortality rates and life expectancy. GPs were offered financial incentives to go to greater lengths to promote good health and encourage people to have screenings.A government white paper called Promoting Better Health said it would \"encourage more preventative medicine and greater efficiency\". Free breast screening was introduced in a bid to reduce breast cancer in women over the age of 50.The mammograms provided X-rays of any changes in the tissue that may otherwise have been undetectable, allowing for earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment. Keyhole surgery - or laparoscopic surgery - was used for the first time in an operation to remove a gallbladder.It was carried out by Sir Alfred Cuschieri at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee.Now one of the most common surgeries performed on the NHS, it sees a thin telescopic rod, lit with a fibre-optic cable and connected to a tiny camera, used to send images of the area being operated on to a monitor so that surgeons can see what they are doing. The NHS and Community Care Act was introduced, creating an internal market in which health authorities could buy individual services from providers to deliver specific care for people in their communities.The government and supporters of the act said it allowed for more efficient delivery of care, but its critics said it would create a two-tier system which was opposed to the original principles of the NHS. The first 57 NHS trusts were established, following on from the NHS Community Care Act the year before.It meant health authorities would manage their own budgets and buy healthcare from hospitals, becoming independent of the centralised NHS to better serve the specific needs of individual communities across the country. Following a five-year campaign by John and Rosemary Cox, who lost their 24-year-old son Peter to a brain tumour in 1989, the NHS Organ Donor Register was set up.Peter had wanted to donate his organs to help others, and his parents believed there should be a register to make it easier for others.Millions of people are now registered. Tony Blair famously told voters they had \"24 hours to save the NHS\" before leading Labour to a landslide election victory in 1997.The health service was a key focus for his campaign, and upon entering Downing Street the change in approach was obvious.A white paper, The New NHS: Modern, Dependable, suggested replacing the internal market introduced in 1990 and making the NHS a more cooperative and integrated system once again.However, the internal market was to remain, only with the idea of purchasing services now known as \"commissioning\". NHS Direct was launched and would go on to become one of the largest e-health services in the world.It was designed to offer a convenient alternative to traditional GPs, but was closed and replaced by NHS 111 in 2014. NHS walk-in centres were introduced, allowing people to receive quick and easy medical services without the need to book an appointment or be registered.They were designed to deal with minor illnesses and injuries, and most are still open 365 days a year, and outside office hours. The NHS Plan brought about the \"biggest change to healthcare in England since the NHS was formed\", as it sought to use increased funding to eliminate inequalities that had existed for decades.The plan acknowledged that patient needs could vary wildly depending on age, income and location. Improving services for older people was a key focus, especially social care. The launch of primary care trusts changed the way the NHS commissioned services.More than 37,000 GPs and 21,000 dentists were overseen by the trusts by the time they were abolished in April 2013, and they controlled 80% of the NHS budget.The trusts were largely administrative, responsible for tasks such as contracting out services to the private sector and managing local services to meet the needs of their communities. GPs were given more say over the range of services they provided and increased wages and pensions as part of new contracts negotiated with the Department of Health.Hospital consultants' contracts were also renegotiated to increase the amount of one-on-one time they spent with patients. The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme was launched, becoming one of the first national schemes of its type in the world.It was the first cancer screening programme in England to include both men and women, with millions screened and thousands of cancers detected every year.Today it is offered to anyone aged 55 and over. Another revolution in healthcare was brought into the NHS, as a state-of-the-art robotic arm was used in an operation at St Mary's Hospital in London.Designed to treat patients for fast or irregular heartbeats, it worked by inserting several fine wires into a vein in the groin, which were then guided towards to the heart.Upon arrival, they delivered an electric current to specific parts of the heart muscle.The whole process was controlled by cardiologists using a joystick. The NHS made a bigger push than ever to encourage people to stop smoking, firstly through the launch of NHS Choices.It was built to offer advice for people to make healthy lifestyle decisions, including tips on how to quit smoking.Weeks later, on 1 July, smoking was banned in restaurants, pubs and other public places as part of the Health Act. Another national vaccination programme was launched, this time to vaccinate girls aged between 12 and 13 against human papilloma virus and help prevent cervical cancer.Since then a debate has raged as to whether teenage boys should also receive the vaccination, at a cost to the NHS of around &#163;22m per year.A debate was held on the issue in the House of Commons in May 2018. With Britons ballooning in size, the Change4Life campaign was set up to encourage people to eat more healthily and exercise more.Britain has continued to battle with a rising obesity rate, with the number of obesity-related hospital admissions increasing once again in 2016-17, but Change4Life has acted as a catalyst for even more NHS-driven campaigns.These include the podcast series Couch To 5K, aimed at encouraging people to take up running. The Care Quality Commission was launched to act as a regulator for health, mental health and adult social care.Inspections are now carried out at hospitals, care homes and other health providers across the country, providing them all with a rating and advice on how to improve.Those struggling the most can be placed in special measures. Despite the coalition government pledging to put a stop to \"top-down reorganisations of the NHS\", reforms drawn up by health secretary Andrew Lansley stood to completely alter the way the health service worked.Hospitals were to be given more freedom, GPs would take control of a huge proportion of the overall budget, and patients would have a voice through a network known as HealthWatch.The changes proved unpopular and Mr Lansley lost his job in 2012. Doctors decided to take industrial action for the first time in almost 40 years due to a row over changes to the NHS pension scheme.The British Medical Association went ahead with the strikes after 79% of almost 18,000 GPs who voted backed taking action.They argued that government proposals would see them working longer and contributing more to their pensions, but end up receiving less once they retire. The opening ceremony of the London Olympics showed off the achievements of the NHS to the world.More than 600 nurses and fellow NHS workers took part in the celebration, which was orchestrated by soon-to-be James Bond director Danny Boyle.He said he wanted to include a tribute to the NHS because it was important to \"everybody in this country\", and its promise of free healthcare was one of the \"core values if our society\". On 27 December, Mark Cahill received the late Christmas present of becoming the first person in the UK to have a hand transplant.It was performed by a surgical team at Leeds General Infirmary, who had to amputate his hand and then transplant a donor hand during the same operation.The procedure became available on the NHS in 2016. Five hospital trusts were placed under investigation over their mortality rates after a damning report into mistreatment of patients at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust found the problems were due to a \"whole system failure\".The scathing inquiry found that up to 1,200 patients had died unnecessarily, with the Department of Health having put cash over patient care and tolerated poor standards.Prime minister David Cameron said the failings meant \"we cannot say with confidence\" that they were \"limited to one hospital\". Wide-ranging reforms were promised as part of the Health and Social Care Act, which focused on putting clinicians at the centre of commissioning, freeing up providers to innovate and empowering patients.Among the changes, clinical commissioning groups began taking on more responsibility for commissioning general practice in their area, and local authorities were given more funding to take on a greater role in improving public health. Replacing NHS Direct, NHS 111 became the free number to call for those with an urgent healthcare need.Available 24\/7 all year round, the service directs callers to the right healthcare provider in their area and is designed to alleviate pressure on GP practices and A&E departments at hospitals across the whole of England. The NHS was found to be the most impressive healthcare system in the world.Influential think-tank the Commonwealth Fund said it was better than those in Australia, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway and the US.It held on to the title in 2017.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the \"outstanding results\" were a \"testament to the dedication of NHS staff\". NHS England, Public Health England, Monitor, Health Education England, the Care Quality Commission and the NHS Trust Development Authority jointly published the Five Year Forward View.It was pitched as a shared vision for the future of the health service.It was the first time the organisations had teamed up to set out a cooperative and coordinated plan, which aimed to reduce health inequalities and meet an estimated &#163;30bn funding gap by 2020-21. NHS workers at Unison voted in favour of strike action in a row over pay, which would prove to be the first of several high-profile strikes in the coming years.The dispute was driven by the lack of a pay rise for what the union claimed to be up to 70% of nurses and 60% of other NHS workers, which had led to a \"demoralised and demotivated workforce\". The Conservatives pledged to continue to work towards the targets of the Five Year Forward View upon their election victory in May.Also in their manifesto was the promise of seven-day access to a GP, of which they aimed to provide 5,000 more, and &#163;8bn a year in additional NHS funding by 2020. More widespread strikes were seen across the UK, this time over changes to the junior doctor contract.As many as 20,000 people marched in London alone on 17 October, with those taking part claiming that a new deal on offer from the government would leave them financially worse off and have them working longer hours.It added further fuel to a bitter row between the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and the British Medical Association, with the former claiming junior doctors were being misled over the contract. The EU referendum saw the NHS politicised like never before, with the promise of &#163;350m extra funding a week if Brexit came to pass swaying many voters towards Leave.NHS England chief Simon Stevens has since used the result to appeal for more government spending on the health service, telling an NHS conference in Birmingham in 2017: \"The NHS wasn't on the ballot paper, but it was on the battle bus. Vote Leave for a better funded health service.\" The NHS continued to look to the future with a partial roll-out of NHS 111 Online, which replicated the phone service in the form of an app.A wider launch is expected in 2018. NHS England published Next Steps On The Five Year Forward View, marking the progress made since the launch of the plan in 2014.The document prioritised plans to improve cancer and mental health services, as well as GP access, but acknowledged that an ambition to provide patients with treatment within 18 weeks of referral was no longer viable.Concerns were also raised over funding and workforce constraints. On 12 May, the NHS was hit by a crippling cyber attack.Hundreds of computers were infected with ransomware called WannaCry, leading to thousands of appointments being cancelled and A&E departments having to turn away ambulances.It was the largest-ever strike of its type on the health service, but could have been halted by \"basic IT security\", according to a later review by the National Audit Office.The NHS and Department of Health were promptly called upon to \"get their act together\" or risk more damaging attacks. As voters were asked to go to the ballot boxes once again for a snap election in June, the NHS proved to be another major issue on the campaign trail.None more so than when it came to a flagship Conservative policy on social care, which was criticised so heavily it was amended.The so-called \"dementia tax\" was hounded at every turn by the other parties and proved unpopular with voters, but was another example of just how much the NHS means to people when it comes to where to place their political allegiance. The results of the most recent GP Patient Survey were positive for the NHS, with 85% of respondents recording a positive experience with their local practice.However, there were a few signs of the growing pressures and demand on the system, with satisfaction rates for getting through to their practice by phone and seeing their preferred GP both significantly down. Mr Justice Langstaff began consulting with families ahead of chairing an inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal of the 1970s and 1980s, which saw more than 3,000 people infected and killed at least 2,400.Prime Minister Theresa May announced the inquiry in the summer of 2017Most of the victims were infected by blood plasma products from commercial manufacturers, provided to patients by the NHS.It has been called the greatest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. The NHS welcomed the introduction of a tax on sugary soft drinks, which forced a number of major manufacturers to cut the amount of sugar in popular brands.The levy saw drinks containing five grams of sugar per 100ml taxed at 18p per litre, and those with more than eight grams per 100ml taxed at 24p per litre.Around 60% of the UK population was deemed overweight at the time, with approximately one in four people obese, and sugary soft drinks accounted for around 20% of the sugar consumed by children.  The NHS will mark its 70th birthday with local, regional and national celebrations, including high street exhibitions, open days and staff awards ceremonies.On the big day itself, all NHS organisations and local communities are being encouraged to hold an NHS Big 7Tea - essentially an opportunity for staff, volunteers, patients and carers to get together for a cuppa and some cake.","wordCount":4391,"genre":"uk news","publisher":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"headline":"NHS at 70: Seventy defining moments","description":"","dateline":"London,UK","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sky News"},"datePublished":"2018-05-01","dateModified":"2018-05-30","dateCreated":"2018-05-01","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/18\/05\/750x563\/skynews-nhs-nurse_4324234.jpg?20180530151359","width":750,"height":563},"url":"\/story\/nhs-at-70-seventy-defining-moments-11355029"}

</div><h2></h2><h2>Tom Acres, news reporter</h2><p>On 5 July, the NHS will celebrate its 70th birthday.</p><p>Now considered the envy of the world so far as health services go, it has certainly come a long way since the idea was first floated by health secretary Aneurin Bevan in 1946.</p><p>Back then, Clement Attlee had just led Labour to victory in the first post-Second World War general election. He quickly made Mr Bevan part of his cabinet, and The National Health Service Act was published in 1946.</p><p>It set out a vision for a "comprehensive health service" for England and Wales, which would become a reality just two years later. There was separate legislation for Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The NHS was born on 5 July, promising nationalised hospitals, a network of GPs, and community health services, all free at the point of use.</p><p>Health secretary Aneurin Bevan launched it at Park Hospital in Manchester, today known as Trafford General Hospital.</p><p>The first patient was Sylvia Diggory, 13, who had a life-threatening liver condition. She went on to become a teacher and her son, Clive Diggory, a GP.</p>

<p>Mental health treatment was absorbed into the NHS through the Percy Commission, which had been set up by Winston Churchill's government.</p><p>It concluded that the law should be changed so that people in need of mental health treatment received care with "no more restriction of liberty" than any other form of care, thus breaking down barriers that had existed before.</p><p>It would be expanded upon further by the 1959 Mental Health Act.</p>

<p>Doctors decided to take industrial action for the first time in almost 40 years due to a row over changes to the NHS pension scheme.</p><p>The British Medical Association went ahead with the strikes after 79% of almost 18,000 GPs who voted backed taking action.</p><p>They argued that government proposals would see them working longer and contributing more to their pensions, but end up receiving less once they retire.</p> <div class="sdc-article-widget sdc-article-image sdc-article-image--full-bleed" data-parallax-role="frame">

<p>The NHS welcomed the introduction of a tax on sugary soft drinks, which forced a number of major manufacturers to cut the amount of sugar in popular brands.</p><p>The levy saw drinks containing five grams of sugar per 100ml taxed at 18p per litre, and those with more than eight grams per 100ml taxed at 24p per litre.</p><p>Around 60% of the UK population was deemed overweight at the time, with approximately one in four people obese, and sugary soft drinks accounted for around 20% of the sugar consumed by children.</p><div><div class="sdc-article-widget sdc-article-related-stories" data-component-name="sdc-article-related-stories">

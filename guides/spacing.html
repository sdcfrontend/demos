          <p>We are using a scaling set of spacing values to create a more fluid layout that looks great no matter what
            proportion and isn’t heavily reliant on specific breakpoints. We can achieve this by supplying a range of
            units that are based off a calculation from the base unit - 18px and scaled up as per below.

            <p>By embracing fluid spacing you may lose some of your “visual” control, but it’s in
              favor of simplicity and maintainability. It is true that you won’t be able to set pixel-perfect values,
              but you will deal with responsiveness to a whole new level: most of the work will be setting a robust
              scale of values for spacing and typography. Then you can edit 2–3 variables at specific media queries to
              create a cascade effect, as opposed to tweaking all components and sub-elements.</p>

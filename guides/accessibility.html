        <h4>Why is accessibility important?</h4>
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>At Sky it is important that our products and services are accessible to everyone who wants to use them, regardless of their abilities. Accessibility is not just our social and legal responsibility, it is an essential part of how we serve our customers. </p>
        </div>
        <h4>What we are committed to</h4>
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Our websites must meet at least level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) and work on the most commonly used assistive technologies such as screen readers and speech recognition tools.

          <p>We will also include people with disabilities in our design and user testing process and provide an accessibility statement that explains how accessible our products are. 
            
          <p>To ensure our products are accessible to all we must consider the needs of a diverse range of users.

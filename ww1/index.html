        <p class="sf-text__lead">World War I, also called First World War or Great War, an international conflict that in 1914–18 embroiled most of
          the nations of Europe along with Russia, the United States, the Middle East, and other regions.

          <p>The war pitted the Central Powers—mainly Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey—against the Allies—mainly France,
            Great Britain, Russia, Italy, Japan, and, from 1917, the United States. It ended with the defeat of the Central
            Powers. The war was virtually unprecedented in the slaughter, carnage, and destruction it caused.


            <p>World War I was one of the great watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history. It led to the fall of four
              great imperial dynasties (in Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey), resulted in the Bolshevik Revolution
              in Russia, and, in its destabilization of European society, laid the groundwork for World War II.
